This directory contains CPM and BIOS for zEDone  
and also an empty CPM disk and a README file  
you should copy this this emty disk to diskA,diskB,diskC and diskD  
This readme file is not up to date but can be usefull  
(a former version of zEDone didn't use zED80 but an other Z80 emulator in C with a pascal layer)
